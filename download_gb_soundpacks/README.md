# GarageBand Sound Pack Installer

This repository contains a script designed for use in environments where **GarageBand** is managed through **Jamf** and **Volume Purchase Program (VPP)** tokens. The goal of this script is to streamline the installation of **additional GarageBand sound packs** (such as instruments and loops) on macOS devices without requiring user interaction or access to the App Store.

## Requirements

- **Jamf Pro** for device management
- **VPP Token** for GarageBand license management
- macOS 10.12 (Sierra) or later
- **GarageBand** must already be installed through Jamf and the VPP process (no user interaction required for installation)
- The device must have internet access to download the sound packs

## What This Script Does

This script is intended for environments where **GarageBand** is deployed via Jamf using VPP tokens. The script performs the following:

- **Silently installs additional sound packs** (such as instruments and loops) for GarageBand.
- **No user interaction** is required, making it ideal for automated deployment across managed macOS devices.
- Uses **`softwareupdate`** to download and install the sound content directly from Apple's software update servers.

## How It Works

1. **VPP-managed GarageBand**: GarageBand is already installed via Jamf and VPP tokens, so no additional installation steps are needed.
2. **Sound Pack Installation**: The script checks for available sound pack updates and installs them silently via `softwareupdate`. This includes instruments and Apple Loops that are typically available as additional content.
3. **Automated Deployment**: Once the script is deployed through Jamf, the sound packs will be installed on all target devices without requiring any user action.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Ensure GarageBand is deployed via Jamf** using your VPP token. GarageBand should be installed and available on the target devices.
2. **Deploy the script to your devices** using Jamf Proâ€™s **Script** functionality. You can target devices or groups of devices to run the script.
3. **Run the script**:
    - The script will automatically check for and install any available GarageBand sound packs.
    - No user input is required.
    - The script logs its progress to `/var/log/garageband_setup.log`.

## Script Overview

The script consists of the following key parts:

- **Log Output**: All actions are logged to `/var/log/garageband_setup.log` for tracking purposes.
- **Sound Pack Installation**: It uses `softwareupdate` to silently install GarageBand sound packs and updates.
- **No User Interaction**: Since the app is VPP-managed and already installed, no App Store interaction is necessary.

## Example Output

The following is an example of the output you can expect in the log file (`/var/log/garageband_setup.log`):

```bash
2025-03-07 10:00:00 - Starting GarageBand content setup...
2025-03-07 10:00:05 - Checking and installing additional GarageBand content...
2025-03-07 10:00:10 - Available GarageBand updates found: "GarageBand Instruments and Apple Loops"
2025-03-07 10:00:15 - Installing GarageBand Instruments and Apple Loops...
2025-03-07 10:00:20 - GarageBand content setup completed.
