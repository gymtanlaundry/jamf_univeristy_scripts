Unity Auto Install & Serialization

This project automates the installation of Unity Hub, downloads the latest Unity Editor (approximately 8GB), and serializes Unity with a valid license. Ideal for IT admins, deployment scripts, and large-scale installations.

Overview

This script:

Installs Unity Hub if not already installed.

Uses Unity Hub CLI to download and install the latest Unity Editor.

Waits for the download (which can take time due to the large size).

Serializes Unity using a provided license key, email, and password.

Why Use This?

Automates the entire Unity setup (no manual downloading needed).

Ensures you get the latest version of Unity Editor.

Ideal for IT departments & deployment using tools like Jamf, Munki, or MDT.

Installation & Usage

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Unity-Auto-Install.git
cd Unity-Auto-Install

2. Make the Script Executable

chmod +x unity_setup.sh

3. Run the Script (With Admin Rights)

sudo ./unity_setup.sh

How It Works

Step 1: Install Unity Hub

The script checks if Unity Hub is installed. If not, it downloads and installs it:

Unity Hub must be installed first since it manages Unity versions.

The Hub is installed from Unity’s official CDN.

Step 2: Install Unity Editor (8GB Download)

The script detects the latest Unity version via Unity Hub CLI.

It downloads (~8GB) and installs the full Unity Editor.

Patience is required due to the large download size.

Step 3: Serialize Unity (License Activation)

Once installed, Unity is activated using a serial key.

Requires Unity credentials (email & password).

Offline activation option available for air-gapped machines.

Customization

Edit unity_setup.sh to update:

Specific Unity versions instead of the latest.

Different Unity Hub download URLs.

Custom installation paths (if not using default /Applications/Unity).
